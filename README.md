# Difference-in-differences
Difference-in-differences (DiD) is a statistical technique used in econometrics and other fields to estimate causal effects of a treatment, policy, or intervention by comparing the changes in outcomes between a treatment group and a control group over time. It attempts to control for time-invariant confounding factors by differencing out the pre-treatment differences between the treatment and control groups.
